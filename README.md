```sql
-- Create polls table
CREATE TABLE polls (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  question TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (char_length(question) <= 500),

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL
);

-- Create votes table
CREATE TABLE votes (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  poll_id UUID REFERENCES polls(id) ON DELETE CASCADE NOT NULL,
  user_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE SET NULL,
  option_index INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW() NOT NULL,
  
  -- Ensure valid option index
  CHECK (option_index >= 0),
  
  -- Prevent duplicate voting by authenticated users
  UNIQUE(poll_id, user_id)
);

-- Create indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_polls_user_id ON polls(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_polls_created_at ON polls(created_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_votes_poll_id ON votes(poll_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_votes_user_id ON votes(user_id);

-- Enable Row Level Security
ALTER TABLE polls ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE votes ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- RLS Policies for polls table
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view polls" ON polls
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Users can create their own polls" ON polls
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own polls" ON polls
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own polls" ON polls
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- RLS Policies for votes table
CREATE POLICY "Anyone can view votes" ON votes
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "Anyone can create votes" ON votes
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Function to update updated_at timestamp
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  NEW.updated_at = NOW();
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ language 'plpgsql';

## üöÄ The Challenge: Security Audit & Remediation

As a developer, writing functional code is only half the battle. Ensuring that the code is secure, robust, and free of vulnerabilities is just as critical. This version of ALX Polly has been intentionally built with several security flaws, providing a real-world scenario for you to practice your security auditing skills.

**Your mission is to act as a security engineer tasked with auditing this codebase.**

### Your Objectives:

1.  **Identify Vulnerabilities**:
    -   Thoroughly review the codebase to find security weaknesses.
    -   Pay close attention to user authentication, data access, and business logic.
    -   Think about how a malicious actor could misuse the application's features.

2.  **Understand the Impact**:
    -   For each vulnerability you find, determine the potential impact.Query your AI assistant about it. What data could be exposed? What unauthorized actions could be performed?

3.  **Propose and Implement Fixes**:
    -   Once a vulnerability is identified, ask your AI assistant to fix it.
    -   Write secure, efficient, and clean code to patch the security holes.
    -   Ensure that your fixes do not break existing functionality for legitimate users.

### Where to Start?

A good security audit involves both static code analysis and dynamic testing. Here‚Äôs a suggested approach:

1.  **Familiarize Yourself with the Code**:
    -   Start with `app/lib/actions/` to understand how the application interacts with the database.
    -   Explore the page routes in the `app/(dashboard)/` directory. How is data displayed and managed?
    -   Look for hidden or undocumented features. Are there any pages not linked in the main UI?

2.  **Use Your AI Assistant**:
    -   This is an open-book test. You are encouraged to use AI tools to help you.
    -   Ask your AI assistant to review snippets of code for security issues.
    -   Describe a feature's behavior to your AI and ask it to identify potential attack vectors.
    -   When you find a vulnerability, ask your AI for the best way to patch it.

---

## Getting Started

To begin your security audit, you'll need to get the application running on your local machine.

### 1. Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v20.x or higher recommended)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
-   A [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) account (the project is pre-configured, but you may need your own for a clean slate).

### 2. Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd alx-polly
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

The project uses Supabase for its backend. An environment file `.env.local` is needed.Use the keys you created during the Supabase setup process.

### 4. Running the Development Server

Start the application in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

Good luck, engineer! This is your chance to step into the shoes of a security professional and make a real impact on the quality and safety of this application. Happy hunting!
